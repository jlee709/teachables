What is a color Gradient?

In computer graphics, a color gradient (sometimes called a color ramp or color progression) specifies a range of position-dependent colors, usually used to fill a region. For example, many window managers allow the screen background to be specified as a gradient. (src => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_gradient)
