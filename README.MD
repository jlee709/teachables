JS BOOSTER!

The purpose of this Repo is to add and provide materials to aid with teaching JavaScript and JS fundamentals in the form of small exercises and mini applications
The difficulty can gradually increase over the course of the material but for now the focus will be giving an instructor (newer instructors) a few exercises they could review with students or mentees

This is aimed at students whose programming level is at the novice to basic level. Goal is to have a collection of materials that can be used by educators to aid in teaching with simple material that can be used ideally in a 2 - 3 hour setting

this could change of course since the material also assumes a small talk or lecture about certain topics. just enough to get your hands dirty and start coding :)

The playground section is a place where students and learners can try new things by playing with some of the html, css and vanilla JS functions to break and play with a scaffold. this is would be ideal for a supplement to the exercises since they can use some of the basics to see where they can improve but get used to the syntax
