Initial Set up, Adding material OST


The purpose of this Repo is to add and provide materials to aid with teaching JS and JS fundamentals in the form of small exercises and mini applications

This is aimed at studetns whos programming level is at the novice to basic level. 

Goal is to have a collection of materials that can be used by educators to aid in teaching with simple material that can be used ideally in a 2 - 3 hour setting 

this could change of course since the material also assums a small talk or lecture about certain topics. just enough to get your hands dirty and start coding :)
