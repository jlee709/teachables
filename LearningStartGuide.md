**Learning Strat Guide:**

This is a collection of common techniques collected from professionals that specialize in learning. Most importantly Learning how to learn.

More specific, finding your learning method that works best for you as a developer

since our field in technology is always changing, and we have many tools to learn on top of many tools, patterns and new technologies that are being released all the time. We as developers need to understand how we each learn at a deeper level.

There are many types of learners and finding your style of learning is a key skill in its own.

This guide will have some extra guidelines (kinda of) and a mix of strategies that can help you learn and also help you understand your favoured learning approach.

**Learning Strategies for Developers:**

1. The Feynman Technique
2. Spaced Repetition + Anki Tool
3. Chunking

This technique was made famous by Richard Feynman, a theoretical Physicist .

**Feynman Technique:**

This technique makes you take 1 concept, and re\*\*write it simply into language and concepts you understand.

This comes from Richards philosophy that => “ If you cant explain something, Simply, you don’t understand it enough”

start by writing a concept in programming that you are not familiar with and write it in terms that you understand then re\*\*write again and try to write it even more simply until you really understand this concept and how it is applied to your chosen field, in this case programming :)

How to Use the Feynman Technique:

Since the root of this technique involves explaining the concept, you could execute it in a number of ways – including literally grabbing a friend and explaining to them what you’re learning.  However, you don’t always have willing friends at hand, so here’s the simpler method that just involves a sheet of paper.

**Step 1:**

Grab a sheet of paper and write the name of the concept at the top. You can use pretty much any concept or idea – even though the technique is named after Feynman, it’s not limited solely to math and science.

**Step 2:**

Explain the concept in your own words as if you were teaching it to someone else. Focus on using plain, simple language. Don’t limit your explanation to a simple definition or a broad overview; challenge yourself to work through an example or two as well to ensure you can put the concept into action.

**Step 3:**

Review your explanation and identify the areas where you didn’t know something or where you feel your explanation is shaky. Once you’ve pinpointed them, go back to the source material, your notes, or any examples you can find in order to shore up your understanding.

**Step 4:**

If there are any areas in your explanation where you’ve used lots of technical terms or complex language, challenge yourself to re-write these sections in simpler terms. Make sure your explanation could be understood by someone without the knowledge base you believe you already have.   TLDR => Pretend you have to explain this concept to a young kid. If you can make the young kid understand simply, you understand the concept :)

**Spaced Repetition:**

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.

Spaced repetition seeks to solve the problem of forgetting. It holds that the ideal moment to remember a new piece of information is at the moment you are about to forget it.

Taking a technique and having spaced repetition helps with muscle memory as well as mental acuity. An example of this would be writing a javascript function in ES5 but then re writing the same functions in ES6 to get used to the syntax.   Taking the function and writing a few basic functions to learn the new syntax is a great way to accelerate learning and getting used to the newer techniques available in a JS feature update Another Example:

**Chunking:**

This is the idea of breaking what you want to learn into concepts. The goal is to learn each concept in a way that they each become like a well known puzzle piece. In order to master a concept, you not only need to know it but also to know how it fits into the bigger picture.

First, survey and priming — this involves scanning a book or the syllabus of a course, for example, to get a general idea of the bigger picture.

Second, observe an example. Then, do it yourself. And, finally, do it again and again in different contexts.

Example Learning React first look over all the units in a course to try to get a general gist of the topics covered. Then, follow along closely.

After that, try building your own application. And finally, apply those learnings into the new features you may be developing at your job or side project.
