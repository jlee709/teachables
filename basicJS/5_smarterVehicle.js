// Make a keyless car EVEN BETTER!
// We are improving our car from previous exercise now.
// Solutions to future exercises will be in the .js file (meaning Javascript file) from now on.

var age = prompt("What is your age?");

//1. Make the above code have a function called checkDriverAge(). Whenever you call this function,
// you will get prompted for age. Use Function Declaration to create this function.
// Notice the benefit in having checkDriverAge() instead of copying and pasting the
//function everytime?

//2. Create another function that does the same thing, called checkDriverAge2()
// using a Function Expression.

//BONUS: Instead of using the prompt. Now, only use the return keyword
//and make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, so that if you enter:
checkDriverAge(21);
//it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"
