// For this exercise look at the following code and predcit what the output will be

// ideal browser should be google chrome :)

Steps: 1. write your ouput for the js code 2. after you have gone through this copy the code in the js console to see if correct 3. to open the js console press cmd + option + j (chrome)

// After you think about the ans, write your ans in comments using // \*your ans
// First go through each line and predict what the output will be in the JS console

```js
//Evaluate the below:
5 + "34"; // write your ans here :)
5 - "4"; // ans
10 % 5; //ans
5 % 10; // ans
"Java" + "Script";
" " + " ";
" " + 0;
true + true;
true + false;
false + true;
false - true;
3 - 4;
"Bob" - "bill";

//Evaluate the below comparisons:
5 >= 1;
0 === 1;
4 <= 1;
1 != 1;
"A" > "B";
"B" < "C";
"a" > "A";
"b" < "A";
true === false;
true != true;
```

After you have attempted these operations. put them into the console to check.

make note of which ones you got wrong then do some googling to find out why you were incorrect :)

then try again with a different operation and make a prediction, repeat until you have it down! :D
